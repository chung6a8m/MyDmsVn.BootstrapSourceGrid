# Compatibility contract

## 1. Supported targets

The product targets:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>net48;net8.0-windows</TargetFrameworks>
<UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms>
```

Both targets are first-class. A shared implementation is preferred.

## 2. Platform

`MyDmsVn.BootstrapSourceGrid` is Windows-only because both the integration and vendors use Windows Forms.

Do not introduce cross-platform assumptions, browser-based rendering, or platform-neutral abstractions that add complexity without a product requirement.

## 3. Language/runtime API compatibility

Code compiled for both TFMs must avoid runtime APIs unavailable on .NET Framework 4.8 unless isolated behind a compatibility helper or target-specific conditional.

Examples of risky categories:

- newer BCL helpers absent from .NET Framework 4.8;
- newer WinForms-only overrides/events not present in the .NET Framework surface;
- nullable/runtime annotations that alter generated metadata unexpectedly;
- APIs that require newer Windows SDK/runtime behavior.

Prefer a single compatible implementation. Use `#if` only for an actual API/platform difference.

Integration-owned projects that enable nullable reference types set `LangVersion` to `12.0` for both target frameworks. This is required because the `net48` compiler default is C# 7.3, and it matches the language version proven by the pinned Bootstrap5WinFormUI baseline. Keep this setting scoped to integration-owned projects; do not alter vendor project files.

## 4. SourceGrid API compatibility

`BootstrapSourceGrid` must remain substitutable for common `SourceGrid.Grid` use.

The integration must not silently redefine:

- `Redim` behavior;
- cell indexers;
- rows/columns semantics;
- positions/ranges/spans;
- selection and active position;
- editor activation/commit/cancel;
- keyboard navigation;
- controller dispatch;
- clipboard behavior;
- scrolling;
- SourceGrid events.

Styling changes must be regression-tested around these behaviors when the changed code can influence them.

## 5. Consumer customization compatibility

Consumer customizations take precedence over integration defaults when they are explicit.

Examples:

- consumer-assigned `Font` wins over automatic Bootstrap body font;
- consumer-assigned SourceGrid View should not be overwritten by a later theme change unless it was created/owned by the integration;
- consumer editor/controller replacement remains valid;
- consumer row heights/column widths are SourceGrid/application-owned and must not be blindly rescaled by Bootstrap code.

## 6. Theme compatibility

The integration follows `BootstrapThemeManager.CurrentTheme` and `ThemeChanged`.

Supported theme behavior includes:

- light theme;
- dark theme;
- custom theme objects compatible with the pinned Bootstrap framework API;
- runtime theme changes after cells, selection, and editors already exist.

A theme change must not clear or reconstruct application data.

## 7. Font compatibility

Default font comes from `CurrentTheme.Typography.Body`.

Ownership contract:

- integration-created font: integration owns/disposes;
- consumer-assigned font: consumer owns; integration must not dispose;
- theme changes update the font only while the control remains in theme-font mode.

## 8. DPI compatibility

BootstrapSourceGrid must work at common Windows scale factors including 100%, 125%, 150%, and 200%.

Rules:

- use `DpiScaler` for metrics introduced by this integration;
- avoid scaling SourceGrid-owned row/column dimensions a second time;
- invalidate/recalculate Bootstrap-owned visual metrics after relevant DPI changes;
- verify selection borders, padding, header content, editor bounds, and text clipping at multiple DPIs.

Where .NET Framework and .NET 8 expose different DPI lifecycle APIs, isolate the difference rather than duplicating entire control implementations.

## 9. Designer compatibility

The control must be safe in the WinForms Designer for both legacy and modern target workflows.

Designer requirements:

- constructor works without application bootstrap;
- no modal UI;
- no background timers/services required for construction;
- no assumption that handle/site/parent is already created;
- public serializable properties have stable defaults;
- repeated create/dispose cycles do not leak theme subscriptions/GDI resources;
- vendor submodule/project references resolve for the design-time build.

Designer validation is manual because successful compilation alone does not prove Designer functionality.

## 10. Binary/source dependency compatibility

During bootstrap, exact vendor commits are consumed through pinned Git submodules and `ProjectReference`.

Do not mix a project reference to one vendor version with a package reference to another copy/version of the same assembly.

When switching to packages, validate assembly identity, public APIs, and transitive dependencies for both TFMs.

## 11. Serialization and application state

MVP introduces no custom persistence format. SourceGrid/application state remains application-owned.

If future Bootstrap-specific properties are Designer-serialized, their defaults must be stable and compatible across both TFMs.

## 12. Accessibility compatibility

Do not remove or weaken accessibility behavior supplied by SourceGrid/WinForms. Integration-specific accessibility properties must be additive and must not change keyboard navigation semantics.

## 13. Performance compatibility

Theme integration must not materially degrade normal SourceGrid painting/scrolling.

Forbidden patterns include:

- rebuilding all grid data on theme change;
- allocating theme/GDI objects per cell on every paint when reusable objects are possible;
- calling full-form invalidation for a grid-only visual change;
- attaching duplicate theme handlers per cell.

## 14. Compatibility validation matrix

Before MVP release, verify at least:

| Area | net48 | net8.0-windows |
|---|---|---|
| Restore/build | Required | Required |
| Unit tests | Required | Required |
| STA control tests | Required | Required |
| Light/dark theme | Required | Required |
| Runtime theme switch | Required | Required |
| Keyboard/editing | Required | Required |
| Selection/focus | Required | Required |
| Spans | Required | Required |
| Scrolling | Required | Required |
| 100%/150%/200% DPI smoke | Required | Required |
| Designer smoke | Required | Required |
| Demo app | Required | Required |

A documented environment limitation may prevent one manual matrix cell from being exercised in CI, but it does not remove the release requirement.
