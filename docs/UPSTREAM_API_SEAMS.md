# Verified upstream API seams

Exact integration facts verified against the pinned vendor baselines. Use this document instead of remembered assumptions; re-verify affected sections whenever a vendor pin changes.

## 1. Baselines

- Bootstrap5WinFormUI: `cceba3c969e28726935793a1c6ca3772bed60a35`
- SourceGrid: `f4e457b43582bf01892f50bdc74aa480531e5944`

## 2. Bootstrap theme seams

Verified:

```csharp
BootstrapThemeManager.CurrentTheme
BootstrapThemeManager.ThemeChanged
BootstrapTheme.CreateDefault(BootstrapThemeMode.Light)
BootstrapTheme.CreateDefault(BootstrapThemeMode.Dark)
BootstrapTheme.Colors
BootstrapTheme.Metrics
BootstrapTheme.Typography
ColorUtil.GetContrastingTextColor(...)
DpiScaler.DefaultDpi
DpiScaler.Scale(int logicalPixels, int dpi)
```

Relevant semantic tokens include `Surface`, `SurfaceSecondary`, `Text`, `MutedText`, `Border`, `Primary`, `Disabled`, `Focus`, `Hover`, and `Active`.

Bootstrap-owned integration metrics currently map from `SpacingXS`, `BorderWidth`, and `FocusBorderWidth`. Do not rescale SourceGrid/application-owned row heights, column widths, or scrollbars.

The pinned `BootstrapDataGridView` remains the reference pattern for theme-owned Font lifetime: construct theme font, replace only owned fonts on theme change, opt out on consumer Font assignment, unsubscribe/dispose owned resources.

`BootstrapTextBox.ApplyThemeFont()` and the lookup popup's `BootstrapDataGridView` preserve their existing owned `Font` when the next theme has an equivalent requested body typography token. They compare the immutable requested token rather than `Font.Name`, because `System.Drawing` can resolve an unavailable family to a different installed font name. WinForms may retain the same resolved `Font` reference on composite child labels when an equality-based property assignment is ignored; disposing it would leave popup and placeholder labels holding a disposed GDI object. Pinned regression tests cover both the default Light-to-Dark switch and an unavailable requested family while the popup is open.

## 3. SourceGrid control and cell/View seams

Verified concrete inheritance:

```text
System.Windows.Forms.Panel
  -> SourceGrid.CustomScrollControl
  -> SourceGrid.GridVirtual
  -> SourceGrid.Grid
  -> BootstrapSourceGrid
```

Normal assignment:

```csharp
grid[row, column] = cell;
```

reaches a private SourceGrid `InsertCell(...)`; subclassing `SetCell(...)` does not intercept every normal assignment.

Approved no-patch visual seam:

```csharp
public override SourceGrid.Cells.ICellVirtual GetCell(int row, int column)
```

Call base, inspect the current View, replace only exact known default singleton identities, preserve all unknown/custom Views, and return the same cell.

Known default identities:

```text
SourceGrid.Cells.Views.Cell.Default
SourceGrid.Cells.Views.Header.Default
SourceGrid.Cells.Views.ColumnHeader.Default
SourceGrid.Cells.Views.RowHeader.Default
```

`ViewBase` exposes style state including `BackColor`, `ForeColor`, `Border`, `Padding`, and `Font`. `CellContext.Position` is available while Views prepare for drawing, allowing one shared ordinary-cell View to compute alternating rows without per-row View allocation.

## 4. Header seams

Generic, column, and row header Views are subclassable. Their default OS-themed backgrounds can be replaced with programmable DevAge visual elements while preserving SourceGrid View/controller behavior:

```text
DevAge.Drawing.VisualElements.Header
DevAge.Drawing.VisualElements.ColumnHeader
DevAge.Drawing.VisualElements.RowHeader
```

The integration replaces only exact SourceGrid default View singleton identities; consumer header Views remain authoritative.

## 5. Selection seams

`GridVirtual.Selection` is exposed as `IGridSelection`, while Bootstrap-relevant visual properties are on `SourceGrid.Selection.SelectionBase`:

```text
BackColor
FocusBackColor
Border
```

Changing `Grid.SelectionMode` recreates the selection object, so integration visual-ownership tracking must reset for the new instance.

Selection visual setters invalidate through their bound grid. During `CreateSelectionObject()`, an integration override that initializes visuals must respect SourceGrid binding order and must not leave duplicate decorators/bindings.

Consumer ownership rule: update a later theme value only when the current property still equals the value last applied by BootstrapSourceGrid.

## 6. SourceGrid editor base lifecycle

### 6.1 EditorBase

Verified public concepts:

```text
EnableEdit
EditableMode
UseCellViewProperties   // default true
```

`SetCellValue(...)` runs the SourceGrid validation/conversion path before writing the final cell value. The adapter may return a string/raw/logical object; SourceGrid remains responsible for converting it to the editor/cell declared value type through its existing validator/type-converter behavior.

### 6.2 EditorControlBase eager control creation

`EditorControlBase` creates and stores its WinForms editor control from `CreateControl()` during editor construction, before any cell starts editing.

The constructor assigns `mControl = CreateControl()`, rejects a null control, and immediately hides it. No grid or cell context is available during this eager construction.

Consequences:

- a Bootstrap editor adapter also creates its composite Bootstrap control eagerly;
- one adapter per cell can create thousands of controls/global theme subscriptions even if never edited;
- Bootstrap adapters must therefore be shared/owned at grid scope rather than created automatically per cell.

### 6.3 Attach/show/focus lifecycle

On first edit, the control is attached through SourceGrid's linked-control mechanism. SourceGrid remains responsible for editor bounds, showing/bringing to front/focus, and hiding at edit end.

The exact pinned first-edit order in `InternalStartEdit(...)` is:

```text
EditorBase.InternalStartEdit(...) validates cell/grid/active position
AttachControl(cellContext.Grid) when not already attached
    -> assign mGrid
    -> create LinkedControlValue
    -> add it to grid.LinkedControls
    -> subscribe Control.Validated and Control.KeyPress
set linked-control position
grid.ArrangeLinkedControls()
OnStartingEdit(cellContext, Control)
SetEditCell(cellContext)
SafeSetEditValue(current cell value)
ShowControl(Control)
```

`AttachControl(...)` is private, and the first protected callback receiving a `CellContext` is `OnStartingEdit(...)`, after `mGrid` and `grid.LinkedControls` have already been mutated. An adapter in this integration assembly therefore has no current SourceGrid seam that can reject a wrong-grid first edit before attachment.

`GetMinimumSize(...)` derives from the editor control's preferred size. Bootstrap editor plans must test preferred/minimum height without silently resizing SourceGrid rows.

### 6.4 Start/value/cancel/commit seams

Verified adapter seams include:

```text
OnStartingEdit(...)
SafeSetEditValue(...)
SetEditValue(...)
GetEditedValue()
OnSendCharToEditor(...)
InternalEndEdit(...)
CellContext.StartEdit()
CellContext.EndEdit(bool cancel)
```

Every concrete `EditorControlBase` subclass must implement the abstract `OnSendCharToEditor(char)` method. `SafeSetEditValue(...)` calls `SetEditValue(...)` and reports initialization failures through the grid user-exception path before applying the editor default. Commit calls `GetEditedValue()` through `ApplyEdit()`, then `SetCellValue(...)`; cancel calls `UndoEditValue()`, which restores the current cell value through `SafeSetEditValue(...)`, without writing an adapter-owned snapshot.

Commit flow uses `GetEditedValue()` then SourceGrid `SetCellValue(...)`. Cancel/reset uses the normal edit-value restore path rather than requiring an integration-side value snapshot system.

### 6.5 View-property propagation

`EditorControlBase.OnStartingEdit(...)` copies cell View `BackColor`, `ForeColor`, and `Font` into `Control` when `UseCellViewProperties == true`.

Legacy MVP styling relies on this behavior. Bootstrap-native adapters must set `UseCellViewProperties = false` so the composite Bootstrap control retains its own theme/font/background/border semantics.

`BootstrapSourceGridEditorStyler` must respect that opt-out and not restyle those adapters.

### 6.6 Control.Validated auto-end-edit behavior

`EditorControlBase` subscribes to `Control.Validated`. While an edit is active, validation/focus transitions can cause SourceGrid to call the edit context's `EndEdit(false)` path.

This is a critical seam for composite controls and especially `BootstrapLookupBox`: popup/result/child focus transitions must not accidentally commit the SourceGrid cell. Solve integration event ordering at the adapter boundary rather than disabling SourceGrid validation globally.

### 6.7 SourceGrid native TextBox compatibility reference

The built-in SourceGrid text editor creates `DevAgeTextBox` with border removed and validator assigned. On edit start it aligns View-dependent settings, initializes the value, and selects text. Its first-character path replaces current text with the typed character and moves the caret to the end.

`BootstrapTextBoxEditor` should preserve these observable edit-entry semantics while letting the Bootstrap control own visuals.

## 7. SourceGrid editor Factory limitation

`SourceGrid.Cells.Editors.Factory` is static/hardwired around built-in editor choices such as text, combo/standard-values, and UITypeEditor paths. No appropriate injection/registration seam was found for globally replacing built-in editors from this integration without changing SourceGrid.

Therefore the Bootstrap editor initiative uses explicit adapters/registry creation and does not override/patch the global factory.

## 8. BootstrapTextBox seams

At the pinned Bootstrap baseline:

- `BootstrapTextBox` is a composite `UserControl` implementing the framework connected-control contract;
- it contains a native text editor exposed to subclasses through a protected `Editor` seam;
- public behavior includes `Text`, `PlaceholderText`, validation state, icon/trailing-icon options, clear-button behavior, `ReadOnly`, password mode, `Clear()`, and `SelectAll()`;
- entering the outer control focuses the inner editor;
- editor events are forwarded through the Bootstrap control lifecycle;
- it subscribes to `BootstrapThemeManager.ThemeChanged` and unsubscribes in disposal;
- consumer Font assignment changes its theme-font ownership behavior.

Adapter consequence: use a narrow internal subclass only for protected caret/selection operations needed by SourceGrid first-character behavior. Do not expose the inner native editor publicly and do not use reflection.

## 9. BootstrapFormattedTextBox seams

At the pinned baseline:

- derives from `BootstrapTextBox`;
- separates formatted/display `Text` from canonical `RawValue`;
- exposes formatting modes including `None`, `General`, `Numeral`, `Date`, `Time`, `CreditCard`, and `Custom`;
- supports formatter/options, raw-value change behavior, caret mapping, and internal undo/redo semantics.

Adapter value contract:

```text
SetEditValue(cell logical value) -> RawValue
GetEditedValue()                  -> RawValue
SourceGrid                        -> final conversion/validation
```

Do not commit formatted `Text` or let `FormatMode` become a second declared cell type system.

## 10. BootstrapLookupBox seams

At the pinned baseline, the lookup model includes:

```text
DataSource
DisplayMember
ValueMember
Columns
SearchMembers
ResultsGrid
SelectedItem
SelectedValue
CommittedDisplayText
HasPendingText
HighlightedItem
MinimumSearchLength
DropDown sizing/behavior
unmatched-text policy
Enter behavior
validation/events
```

Useful selection/edit APIs include `SelectItem`, `SelectValue`, `ClearSelection`, and `CancelPendingEdit`.

`SelectionCommitted` distinguishes `Keyboard`, `Mouse`, `ExactMatch`, `CommitAndAdd`, `Programmatic`, and `Clear`. The public `ClearSelection()` path emits `Clear`, including programmatic clearing, so the SourceGrid adapter must not treat either `Programmatic` or `Clear` as a user selection that automatically ends the cell edit.

`BootstrapTextBox` forwards its native text editor's key-down event through the protected virtual
`OnEditorKeyDown` seam. `BootstrapLookupBox` overrides that seam and consumes Escape plus handled
Enter behavior itself. Consequently, returning `false` from the composite control's `ProcessCmdKey`
is insufficient for SourceGrid when focus is inside the native child. The integration subclass must
intercept closed-popup Escape before the lookup override and bridge closed-popup Enter after pending
text resolution succeeds; it must delegate popup-open key behavior unchanged.

Adapter value contract:

```text
configuration first
SetEditValue(cell logical value) -> SelectedValue
GetEditedValue()                  -> SelectedValue
```

Display text is not the logical cell value when `ValueMember` is configured.

### Lookup dropdown controller behavior

The pinned dropdown controller already owns popup/overlay tracking, focus-domain handling, result-grid navigation, message-filter installation/removal, anchor tracking, application/window deactivation handling, theme updates, result mouse commit, Escape cancellation, and disposal.

It deliberately restores/keeps focus on the lookup editor in several popup/result-grid paths. This makes the control a good candidate for a thin adapter, but SourceGrid's outer `Control.Validated` subscription still requires an explicit interaction test matrix.

Do not fork or duplicate the popup controller in this repository unless a standalone BootstrapLookupBox test proves a vendor defect independent of SourceGrid.

## 11. Bootstrap editor lifetime/ownership seam

One SourceGrid `EditorControlBase` can be assigned to multiple cells in the same grid because only one edit for that editor is active at a time. An editor/control that has attached to one grid must not be treated as safely shareable with another grid.

Approved integration model:

```text
BootstrapSourceGrid
    -> grid-owned editor registry
        -> small set of shared adapters
            -> eager Bootstrap control instances
```

The implemented public entry point is one read-only registry per grid:

```csharp
BootstrapSourceGridEditorRegistry BootstrapSourceGrid.BootstrapEditors { get; }

BootstrapTextBoxEditor CreateTextBox(Type valueType);
BootstrapFormattedTextBoxEditor CreateFormattedTextBox(Type valueType);
BootstrapLookupBoxEditor CreateLookupBox(Type valueType);
```

Adapter constructors are internal and receive the creating grid. The constructor argument is
validated before eager `EditorControlBase` control creation. Registry creators reject a null
`valueType` before constructing an adapter.

The registry/grid must dispose adapters/controls that were created but never attached, because SourceGrid cannot own a control it never received through its linked-control path.

Cross-grid adapter reuse is explicitly unsupported. The supported grid-owned registry creation flow will avoid encouraging it, but this baseline does not promise a deterministic fail-before-attach exception: the only callback available to an integration adapter runs after SourceGrid has already changed `mGrid`/`LinkedControls`. A post-attach guard would leave partially mutated SourceGrid state and must not be added. Deterministic fail-before-attach enforcement requires a separately approved SourceGrid pre-attach seam.

`EditorBase` is indirectly `IDisposable` through `DevAge.ComponentModel.ComponentLight`. That disposal contract removes the component from its site/container and raises `Disposed`; neither `EditorBase` nor `EditorControlBase` overrides it to dispose `EditorControlBase.Control`. The integration registry must therefore dispose the owned control as well as the editor component so both Bootstrap resources/theme subscriptions and SourceGrid component lifetime are released, including for an editor that was never attached.

## 12. Scrollbar seam

`SourceGrid.CustomScrollControl` owns horizontal/vertical native scrollbars and scrolling layout. Current work leaves this subsystem unchanged.

## 13. Upgrade re-verification checklist
